# Overview
The Hyperledger Foundation is launching the Hyperledger Challenge to harness the power of communities to ideate, develop, and launch innovative solutions developed using open-source technologies. Any innovation that advances the current state-of-the-art of enterprise-grade distributed ledger technologies leveraging one or more Hyperledger projects is eligible for the Hyperledger Challenge. 

The Challenge will feature three rounds, called “Ideate”, “Prototype”, and “Launch”, to develop innovations from idea to sustainable solutions in the manner of months. Innovators competing in the challenges will have access to training, mentors  and the Hyperledger community to support the development of their solution.  The Hyperledger community is committed to be a driving force to incorporating Diversity, Civility, and Inclusion into programs. Innovators are greatly encouraged to consider diversity and inclusion when developing their teams.

The Hyperledger Foundation hosts a number of enterprise-grade blockchain software projects. The projects are conceived and built by the developer community for vendors, end user organizations, service providers, start-ups, academics and others to use to build and deploy blockchain networks or commercial solutions. This challenge will feature:
*   A network of support for future innovators to advance the current state-of-the art of enterprise-grade distributed ledger technologies. 
*   A place to partner with similar entrepreneurs, to connect with leading experts, to learn, to scale up, and to achieve real impact in the world.

The Hyperledger Foundation is committed to creating a safe and welcoming community for all. Therefore, all innovators of the Hyperledger Challenge are requested to visit the Hyperledger Code of Conduct and Antitrust Policy Notice.
