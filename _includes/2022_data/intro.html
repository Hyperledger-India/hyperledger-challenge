                    Challenge to harness the power of communities to ideate,
                    develop, and launch innovative solutions developed using
                    open-source technologies. Any innovation that advances the
                    current state-of-the-art of enterprise-grade distributed
                    ledger technologies leveraging one or more

                    is eligible for the Hyperledger Challenge.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify paragraph-custom">The Challenge will feature three rounds, called “Ideate”,
                    “Prototype”, and “Launch”, to develop innovations from idea
                    to sustainable solutions in the manner of months. Innovators
                    competing in the challenges will have access to training,
                    mentors  and the Hyperledger community to support the
                    development of their solution.  The Hyperledger community is
                    committed to be a driving force to incorporating Diversity,
                    Civility, and Inclusion into programs. Innovators are
                    greatly encouraged to consider diversity and inclusion when
                    developing their teams.</p>
