*Innovators DEVELOP to prototype* their proposed solution that sufficiently proves the critical functionality. The prototype must sufficiently demonstrate that the solution will fulfill a market need that sustains its follow-on development.

### Prizes
*    Winners of the prototype challenge will have their project featured as a Linux Foundation Crowdfunding project and Hyperledger Lab project for follow-on collaborative development.
*    Winners will also be provided marketing support including the opportunity to demonstrate their solution to the Technical Steering Committee, Special Interest Groups, and promotion across Hyperledger channels.
